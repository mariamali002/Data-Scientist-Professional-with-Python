# Efficient Storage Solution for Training Data Ltd. Customer Dataset
### Overview
 This project aims to develop an efficient storage solution for Training Data Ltd.'s customer dataset to facilitate faster model training and prediction generation. The dataset provided, customer_train.csv, contains anonymized student information along with indicators of whether they are looking for a new job or not during training.
#### Dataset Description
The provided dataset includes the following columns:

student_id: A unique ID for each student.
city: A code for the city the student lives in.
city_development_index: A scaled development index for the city.
gender: The student's gender.
relevant_experience: An indicator of the student's work relevant experience.
enrolled_university: The type of university course enrolled in (if any).
education_level: The student's education level.
major_discipline: The educational discipline of the student.
experience: The student's total work experience (in years).
company_size: The number of employees at the student's current employer.
last_new_job: The number of years between the student's current and previous jobs.
training_hours: The number of hours of training completed.
job_change: An indicator of whether the student is looking for a new job (1) or not (0).

#### Project Objectives
Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, characteristics, and potential areas for optimization.
Implement data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality and reduce redundancy.
Explore efficient storage formats and compression methods suitable for large-scale datasets.
Evaluate the performance and storage efficiency of different storage solutions.
Develop a proof-of-concept demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed storage solution.
